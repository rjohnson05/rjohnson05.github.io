        <h1>My Article on Three Websites: Two Great... One Not So Much</h1>
      </header>

      <section>
        <p>Websites are a vital part of making a good impression for a business in the modern world.
        The presentation of your website could make or break the experience of many potential
        customers looking for a place to spend their hard-earned money. However, it can be hard
        to understand what customers are looking for in a website. Are the aesthetics most
        important, or should content be the main focus? Is a one-page website better, or should
        I spread my content across multiple pages? As a guide, I now present two websites that
        represent top-notch websites that draw the customer in to their product, as well as the
        opposite: a website that repels customers.</p>

        <h3>Great Website: <a href="https://boostedusa.com">Boosted USA</a></h3>
        <p>Boosted USA has created an amazing website that immerses the visitor in their product.
        The main menu is simple, yet makes allows for easy navigation around the webiste.
        Additionally, it stays fixed to your screen as you scroll through the website, adding to the
        ease with which you are able to navigate across various pages. One cool feature this website
        has added is the pop-up window in the bottom left, telling you what others are "buying". This
        is just another encouragement for you to join what others are already doing: buying their product.

        On the main page, the layout switches between 1,2,and 3-column. Although this doesn't sound
        like the best design at first, Boosted USA has made it work surprisingly well. The change
        in column number is used to explain the partnership the company is trying to emphasize: joining
        with Evolve Skateboards. A 2-column display is used to display both Boosted USA information, as well
        as Evolve Skateboards information.

        The color scheme also adds to the aesthetics of the webiste. Throughout all of the home page, Three
        main colors are used: white, black, and an orange color. Most buttons/links are shown with the orange
        color, while the rest of the text is alternately shown in white and black. Additionally, the backgrounds
        between different sections of the page alternate between black and white.</p>

        <h3>Great Website: <a href="https://kinhr.com">Kin</a></h3>
        <p>Kin's website has a unique feel, with a basic layout that lends itself to an simple navigation style.
        Although there aren't any whistles or bells, it is refreshing to see that a website can still look extremely
        good with only a few basic colors and a knowledgeable web designer. Differing from many websites, Kin has
        chosen to split the main menu onto either side of the screen. Instead of centering it, each half of the menu
        is placed on opposite sides of the logo. The code is modern, using HTML5. Most of the website is split into
        several columns, allowing for the presentation of more content in a more eye-catching manner. Between sections,
        the transitions are not simply lines perpedicular to the sides of the screen, but rather are at an angle, creating
        a unique feel to the site. Similar to the website for Boosted USA, only a few colors are used throughout the
        website: white and black for the text and two shades of blue for backgrounds and button fills.</p>

        <h3>Terrible Website: <a href="http://www2.pnwx.com">Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc.</a></h3>
        <p>This website looks awful. There is no main menu and what exists as a logo is not visually appearing. The
        flashing colors in the logo are distracting from the rest of the content. At least 5 colors are used on the home page,
        creating a sense of haphazard color scheming. The list of products is very basic and not visually appealing in the
        slightest. Each of the product images is identical: a skull. All of the product titles have periods at the end, as well
        as being underlined. This does not look good. When looking at various product pages, it looks like content was thrown onto
        the page without any reasoning. There are not any clear columns, but instead haphazard placement creates a sense of
        clutter. In the footer for each product page, there are again more bright colors that are hard to read against the
        background and really don't fit the theme of the website. Again, the text appears to have been thrown into the footer without
        any real intentionality as to where it was placed. Overall, the way in which the content on this website is presented is
        distracting and not enjoyable to look at.</p>
