    <h1>Ranking my Favorite State Websites:</h1>

    <h2>1. <a href="https://www.nebraska.gov">Nebraska</a></h2>
    <p>This website is definitely my favorite! The header looks clear and concise, with logos next to each of the different dropdown menus. The first thing I noticed were the round buttons beneath the rounded search box. These round edges are a change from many websites, which look much more blocky. Additionally, the home page is not overloaded with lots of information. There are a few pieces of information and then many aesthetic links to the rest of the website. Throughout the website, pages tend to be shorter than other sites, such as Deleware, which is beneficial to the navigation of the site. Overall, this website is very well done.</p>

    <h2>2. <a href="https://delaware.gov">Deleware</a></h2>
    <p>This website was quite good, but not as exquisite as Nebraska's design. The main negative against this webiste are the lengths of the webpages. Rather than providing links to the rest of the website via dropdown menus in the header, links were scattered throughout the LONG home page. It feels like you could just keep scrolling forever. This lack in the menu also creates navigation issues, making it difficult to get to the desired page quickly. This website is pretty good, but could use a few tweaks.</p>

    <h2>3. <a href="https://www.illinois.gov">Illinois</a></h2>
    <p>This website was pretty decent, but the color design was not as good as the previous two. Each page had a subheader, providing links to various pages, which was an acceptable alternative to having dropdown menus in the main header. Overall, the design of the website was pretty good. Yet, the color design throughout the website took away from the visual appeal. The alternation between light blue and white for most of the content, while having a darker blue color for the footer does not look as nice as the cream/dark blue/gray alternations from the first two websites.</p>

    <h2>4. <a href="https://www.myflorida.com">Florida</a></h2>
    <p>Although the homepage looks nice, navigation is extrememly difficult. If you don't know exactly what you're looking for, there is no way to browse the website. The search bar is the main avenue of navigation for the website, which is not always beneficial. However, the design itself is very appealing.</p>

    <h2>5. <a href="https://www.alaska.gov">Alaska</a></h2>
    <p>This website doesn't look all that great. The pages do not extend to the edges of the screen. Rather, they displayed in a box that is overlayed over the top of a background image. For some pages, this might look okay, but not for the entire site...especially not the home page! Additionally, the dropdown menu has so many items for some categories that the user must scroll down to see the bottom of the menu. This does not look good, nor is it efficient. While this website is sufficient to convey information, it is not visually appealing.</p>
