        <h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
        <p>What is our goal at Hope Kids? The answer lies in our mission statement:</p>
        <div class='centered'><p>"To empower children to draw closer in their relationship with Jesus Christ – by teaching the Truth of the Bible and the skills necessary to apply that Truth to our lives, and through equipping parents with the necessary resources to continue fostering this relationship at home."</p></div>
        <p id="mission">Teach & Equip to Empower!</p>

        <h1>OUR VISION</h1>
        <p>What do want to see as we continue serving in Hope Kids? This is answered in our vision:</p>
        <div class='centered'><p>“To see the lives of children, parents, and volunteers transformed through the work of Jesus Christ.”</p></div>

        <h1>OUR VALUES</h1>
        <p>What are some qualities that are vital to our ministry? These would be our core values:</p>
        <p class='value_heading'><b>1.	Relationship</b></p>
        <img src='images/friendship.jpg' id='friendship'>
        <p class='values'>It is key that all parties involved in Hope Kids are relationally connected. We must learn to connect with the children we are serving. They will only care what we are teaching them if they know we care about them personally. We will also grow closer as a Hope Kids volunteer family. Only with relationship will come the ability to bounce ideas off each other (good & not so good ideas) and find the best way to serve God’s children. Most importantly, we must remain in close relationship with God. Without this friendship, the whole of this ministry is pointless.</p>
        <p class='value_heading'><b>2.	Grace</b></p>
        <p>We must come to have grace: with each other and with the kids we are teaching. None of us are perfect and neither are the kids. Learn to deal with this human imperfection and show an undeserving kindness that sets others at ease. Remember God’s gift of grace to all of us in His underserved act of forgiveness.</p>
        <p class='value_heading'><b>3.	Service</b></p>
        <img src='images/volunteer.png' id='volunteer'>
        <p class='right-align'>We should have the heart of servants as we teach children about God. This includes a humility and love for others that does not seek personal gain. Jesus even described Himself as a servant. Shouldn’t it be our goal to follow His example?</p>
